After years of it being joked about the SSE is finally getting a robotic arm to wave at tours.  Join the slack channel or attend a meeting in the SSE Wednesdays at 5!

  Printing is almost done!  Take a look in the pictures folder to see some of the stuff we've done so far.  With the last few things getting printed this week I hope to have the motors and arduino ordered early next week.  Everyone be ready to write some code soon!
  
  Please fork this repo so we can all work on the code for the motors.  If you don't know how to fork the repo please contact Peyton Schmidt (pcs7709@rit.edu).  See you all in the lab!
